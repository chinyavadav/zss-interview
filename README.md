# ZSS ONLINE BOOKSHOP

ZSS Online Bookshop allows customers to view books and purchase them.
After purchase, home deliveries can be made to the provided address!

## Assumptions

1. All books are hard copies
2. Books are to be delivered at the provided address after successful purchase
3. Customer provides email for subsequent communication and query handling
4. All ISBN Codes are numeric with lengths 10 to 13
5. All PANs are  a 16 Digit Number
6. IDE has Maven & Lombok Plugins installed


## What I would have done better

1. Implement Spring Security for the rest of the endpoints excluding /book/purchase and /book/category/**
2. Manually create methods and construction instead of Lombok autogenerated
3. Write Tests to ensure TDD
4. Create endpoints for fetching Payments
5. Validate all fields
6. More comments
7. More Logging
8. Add environments for production, test & staging
9. Port 8080 is vacant

## Installation

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/librarydb
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=
```

1. Create postgres database named "librarydb"
2. Update postgres username,password and port as per above snippet
3. Run the following Maven Commands within the terminal from inside the project root folder

```bash
mvn install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
